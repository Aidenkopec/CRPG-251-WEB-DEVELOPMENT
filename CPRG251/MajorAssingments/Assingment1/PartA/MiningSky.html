            <i>Homo sapiens'</i> need for resources is voracious and unending; anything less than 100% efficiency in
            recycling,
            reuse or repurposing means that new material sources must be found and refined… and the Earth has only so
            much
            to give.

        <p>
            The deepest mine on Earth - the Mponeng digging in South Africa - penetrates less than 4km below the
            surface. At
            that depth, the rock sizzles at 60°C, as workers sweat and scramble to extract gold from a single seam less
            than
            a meter wide. Meanwhile, untold wealth is orbiting in the sky, far above our heads.

        <h2>Formation</h2>
        <div class="">
            <p>
                The fundamental elements of the Universe - hydrogen and helium - were formed during the Big Bang. Drawn
                together, these elements form stars, where almost every other atomic structure is cooked into existence.
                When
                these suns explode as supernova, their structure is ejected into the galaxy at close to the speed of
                light.
                Over
                billions of years, drawn together by gravitational perturbation, particles from different suns collect
                and
                clump
                together. Gravity and spin do the rest, forming new stars and planets - heavy, mineral-rich rocky
                bodies,
                gas
                giants, and icy worldlets - and eventually, you: the iron in your blood, the calcium in your teeth, were
                all
                formed in the hearts of stars.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                This process is not perfect: floating between the planets are billions of half-formed structures, the
                leftover
                and discarded remnants of the solar system. These asteroids contain the raw ingredients of the cosmic
                construction process; in our local solar system, they are classified by both composition and distance.
                The
                metallic-bearing asteroids, known as M-types, are the third most populous type, and there are millions
                of
                them.

            Trillions
        </h2>

        <p>Some of these bodies are huge: one of the largest, 511 Davida, is 270 ~ 310 kilometres in diameter, and 50
            sextillion kilos in mass, much of it nickel and iron. If it could be retrieved and mined, the asteroid’s ore
            would be worth over 100 trillion dollars on today’s market. Another, 16 Psyche, is thought to be the
            shattered
            iron core of a protoplanet.</p>

        <p>Of course, the mass and composition of an asteroid is not the only determinate of how profitable it might be.
            The
            body’s orbit is also important - Davida is more than three times the Earth’s distance from the sun, for
            example
            - and the technology required to mine in zero gravity has yet to be developed. More fundamentally, we’re
            barely
            capable of landing on planets in the solar system in a predictable way, much less asteroids.</p>

        <h2>Other Sources</h2>
        <p>

            However, asteroids are not the only source of wealth near the Earth: the Moon has been collecting Helium-3
            on
            its surface from the sun’s solar wind for billions of years, which could be used to power fusion reactors.
            Comets can provide water, methane, and other chemicals.
